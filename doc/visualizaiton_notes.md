* We want to be able to use the same technique to visualize the clusters created by
  each of the different clustering algorithms
* The simplest way for now, is to use PCA to get the first two principal components
  and then plot PC-1 on the x-axis and PC-2 on the y-axis
* This can be easily automated with a script given a model and a dataset
* The labels we then apply to the clustered data can then come from seasons and player names
